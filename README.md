## Overview

Users should be able to:

    the navigation links

    size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge enabled me to have more understing of how to create dropdown
menu/lists and a hamburger. Also more knowledge of flexbox, media queries
positioning.

### Continued development

I will like to learn more on dimming the background when the hamburger opens and
closing the hamburger menu when a user clicks outside of it. Right now, I worked
around it but I'm thinking there is a better way to implement them.
